[CHECK THE WEBSITE HERE!](https://janviaroraa.github.io/Hangman-Game/)

This is a simple Break-Out Game, i.e., when you enter the website the game starts and the ball starts to bounce. Whenever the ball touches the upper blue block, the block destroys and the player earns a point. But if somehow the player loses the track of the ball and it falls down, then one life is deducted from the provided 5 lives. If everything goes well, the player reaches the next level. As the levels increase, the number of walls to break also increases, i.e., the difficulty level of the game increases.
